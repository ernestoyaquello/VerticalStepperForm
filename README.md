## Support This Library

The creation (and maintenance) of this library requires time and effort. If you find it useful and want to support it, please use the link below:

## How To Use It
### 1. Reference The Library

Add the library to your project via `mavenCentral` by adding the following in the app's `build.gradle` file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.ernestoyaquello.stepperform:vertical-stepper-form:2.7.0'
}
```

> Make sure you are using AndroidX instead of the old support libraries; otherwise this library might not work.

### 2. Add The Form To Your Layout

Add the view `VerticalStepperFormView` to your layout using XML. For design purposes, it is recommended that you don't put anything else than this view in the layout of the screen that will contain the form:

```xml
<!-- new_user_form_activity.xml -->
<ernestoyaquello.com.verticalstepperform.VerticalStepperFormView
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/stepper_form"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    app:form_circle_background_color="@color/colorPrimary"
    app:form_next_button_background_color="@color/colorPrimary"
    app:form_next_button_pressed_background_color="@color/colorPrimaryDark"/>
```

As you can see in this example, only the properties `form_circle_background_color`, `form_next_button_background_color` and `form_next_button_pressed_background_color` are being used to configure the form, but **there are plenty of other ones that you can use to customize it as you please**.

### 3. Define Your Steps

Each one of the fields of your form **must be defined as a step**.

To define a step, create a class that extends `Step<T>`, where `T` will be the type of the step's data (e.g., `String` if the data of the step is the user's name, `Integer` if it is the user's age, etc). For instance:

```java
public class UserNameStep extends Step<String> {

    private EditText userNameView;

    public UserNameStep(String stepTitle) {
        super(stepTitle);
    }

    @Override
    protected View createStepContentLayout() {
        // Here we generate the view that will be used by the library as the content of the step.
        // In this case we do it programmatically, but we could also do it by inflating an XML layout.
        userNameView = new EditText(getContext());
        userNameView.setSingleLine(true);
        userNameView.setHint("Your Name");
        ...
        userNameView.addTextChangedListener(new TextWatcher() {
            ...
            @Override
            public void onTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int before, int count) {
                // Whenever the user updates the user name text, we update the state of the step.
                // The step will be marked as completed only if its data is valid, which will be
                // checked automatically by the form with a call to isStepDataValid().
                markAsCompletedOrUncompleted(true);
            }
        });

        return userNameView;
    }
    
    @Override
    protected IsDataValid isStepDataValid(String stepData) {
        // The step's data (i.e., the user name) will be considered valid only if it is longer than 
        // three characters. In case it is not, we will display an error message for feedback.
        // In an optional step, you should implement this method to always return a valid value.
        boolean isNameValid = stepData.length() >= 3;
        String errorMessage = !isNameValid ? "3 characters minimum" : "";

        return new IsDataValid(isNameValid, errorMessage);
    }

    @Override
    public String getStepData() {
        // We get the step's data from the value that the user has typed in the EditText view.
        Editable userName = userNameView.getText();
        return userName != null ? userName.toString() : "";
    }

    @Override
    public String getStepDataAsHumanReadableString() {
        // Because the step's data is already a human-readable string, we don't need to convert it.
        // However, we return "(Empty)" if the text is empty to avoid not having any text to display.
        // This string will be displayed in the subtitle of the step whenever the step gets closed.
        String userName = getStepData();        
        return !userName.isEmpty() ? userName : "(Empty)";
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStepOpened(boolean animated) {
        // This will be called automatically whenever the step gets opened.
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStepClosed(boolean animated) {
        // This will be called automatically whenever the step gets closed.
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onStepMarkedAsCompleted(boolean animated) {
        // This will be called automatically whenever the step is marked as completed.
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStepMarkedAsUncompleted(boolean animated) {
        // This will be called automatically whenever the step is marked as uncompleted.
    }

    @Override
    protected void restoreStepData(String stepData) {
        // To restore the step after a configuration change, we restore the text of its EditText view.
        userNameView.setText(stepData);
    }
}
```

Most of the methods showed above will be called automatically by the library. For example, every time the user opens a step, the callback `onStepOpened()` will be invoked and the open step will be marked as completed or uncompleted automatically depending on the value returned by `isStepDataValid()`. Then, the callback `onStepMarkedAsCompleted()`, if applicable, will also be invoked.

It is worth noting that each step has a reference to the context accessible through `getContext()` and a reference to the form accessible through `getFormView()`, as well as several other useful methods.

### 4. Set Up The Form And Initialize It

Once you have defined all your steps, you will need to find the view of the form to set it up and initialize it:

```java
public class CreateUserAccountActivity extends Activity implements StepperFormListener {

    private UserNameStep userNameStep;
    private UserEmailStep userEmailStep;
    private UserAgeStep userAgeStep;
    
    private VerticalStepperFormView verticalStepperForm;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.new_user_form_activity);

        // Create the steps.
        userNameStep = new UserNameStep("User Name");
        userEmailStep = new UserEmailStep("User Email");
        userAgeStep = new UserAgeStep("User Age");

        // Find the form view, set it up and initialize it.
        verticalStepperForm = findViewById(R.id.stepper_form);
        verticalStepperForm
            .setup(this, userNameStep, userEmailStep, userAgeStep)
            .init();
    }

    @Override
    public void onCompletedForm() {
        // This method will be called when the user clicks on the last confirmation button of the 
        // form in an attempt to save or send the data.
    }

    @Override
    public void onCancelledForm() {
        // This method will be called when the user clicks on the cancel button of the form.
    }

    @Override
    public void onStepAdded(int index, Step<?> addedStep) {
        // This will be called when a step is added dynamically through the form method addStep().
    }

    @Override
    public void onStepRemoved(int index) {
        // This will be called when a step is removed dynamically through the form method removeStep().
    }
}
```

As you can see in the code above, we set up the form by passing several parameters through the method `setup()`:

1. An implementation of the interface `StepperFormListener` (in this case, this listener is implemented by the activity, so we just send `this` as a parameter).
2. The steps that will be displayed in the form: `userNameStep`, `userEmailStep` and `userAgeStep` in our example.

However, **we can also customize the form just before initializing it**:

```java
verticalStepperForm
    .setup(this, userNameStep, userEmailStep, userAgeStep)
    .allowNonLinearNavigation(true)
    .displayBottomNavigation(false)
    .lastStepNextButtonText("Create User")
    ...
    .init();
```

There are many methods available to customize the form, but **all the configuration options that you can specify via code are also available in XML**, so it is up to you to set up the form in one way or another.

#### About The Listener

These are the two most important methods of the `StepperFormListener`:

##### `onCompletedForm()`

This method will get called when the user clicks on the last confirmation button of the form in an attempt to save/send the information, so **we can use it to save or send the data of the form**. It is worth noting that it will only get invoked if all the steps are marked as completed.

Just before calling this method, the form disables the navigation between steps, as well as all the buttons. To revert the form to normal (for example, because the data couldn't be saved and we want to re-activate the buttons of the form), it is necessary to call `verticalStepperForm.cancelFormCompletionOrCancellationAttempt()`.

##### `onCancelledForm()`

This method will get called when the user clicks on the optional cancellation button of the last step in order to avoid saving/sending the data. **We can use it to ask the user to confirm the cancellation**, after which we could just close the form screen and navigate away from it.

Right before calling this method, the form disables the navigation between steps, as well as all the buttons. To revert the form to normal (for example, because the user decides not to cancel it), it is necessary to call `verticalStepperForm.cancelFormCompletionOrCancellationAttempt()`.
